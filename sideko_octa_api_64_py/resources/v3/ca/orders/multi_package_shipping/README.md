Updates the status of order lines to**Shipped**and trigger the charge to the customer. This API supports shipping orders in single or multiple packages. You must acknowledge your orders before sending a shipping update to avoid underselling. After canceling your order, update the inventory for the canceled order and send it in the next inventory feed. An order line, once marked as shipped, cannot be updated.

**NOTE:shipDateTime must be in UTC. **

The response to a successful call contains the order with the shipped line item.

#### Multi-package shipment

This API can be used to ship an orderline in one single or in multiple packages. If multiple packages are needed to ship an orderline, all packages must be shipped from the **same country** using the **same carrier**. In one shipment, multiple packages of a **single quantity** can be shipped.
